dummy variables and dummy variable trap 
we should not include all dummy variables
suppose there are 2 varibles athatr are d1 = 1- d2
The dummy variable trap is a situation that arises when dealing with categorical variables in regression analysis or machine learning models. It occurs when two or more dummy variables are highly correlated, leading to multicollinearity.

In the context of categorical variables with two categories (binary), a common approach is to create dummy variables to represent each category. For example, if you have a variable "Color" with categories "Red" and "Blue," you might create a dummy variable like this:

Dummy variable 1 (Red): 1 if the color is Red, 0 otherwise.
Dummy variable 2 (Blue): 1 if the color is Blue, 0 otherwise.
The trap occurs when you include both dummy variables in a regression model. If one variable can be perfectly predicted from the other, it leads to multicollinearity, which can cause issues in the estimation of model coefficients.
